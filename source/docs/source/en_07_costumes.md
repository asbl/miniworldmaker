Costumes and Background
========

Every Actor has a costume

```eval_rst
.. inheritance-diagram:: miniworldmaker.tokens.actor.Actor
   :top-classes: miniworldmaker.tokens.token.Token
```

The images are automatically added to a *costume*. 
A costume collects multiple images and allows you to combine animations.

Later you will also learn how to change costumes, e.g. to jump between animations.
