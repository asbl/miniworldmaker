  * 08.04.2019 : Again many changes in the API. Started english translation.

  * 25.03.2019 : Work on the containers, especially the ActorToolbar was added.

  * 23.03.2019 : A new class token has been added, which acts as parent class of the class actor.
  Also the dependencies to the features (sound, databases, GUI) have been changed:
    * Easygui has been thrown out because the clean solution is to write your own programs directly with easygui.
    * Databases (in process) have been changed. In the future a board with tokens and actors can store itself in a database.
    * Sound has migrated to the class board.

  * 20.03.2019 : A new example for a Robo-World example was created. 
  Objective: With the Create-the-World example robot worlds should be created. 
  The results should be loaded later by students.
